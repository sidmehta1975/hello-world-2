Hi all

My name is Siddharth Mehta and I'm trying to learn how to use github. I am an HR professional that is passionate about using data to improve decisions made on and for the workforce of any organisation. In order to fulfill my ambition I completed a masters in businesss analytics from the stern school of business in 2015. Through the course I learned a lot of data science techniques and most improtantly got expose to programming in R.

I have been using R since 2014 and love the ability it has afforded to make sense of any dataset. I want to now learn how I could save all the code I create on github so that i could easily share it with others that may benefit from it and those that could collborate with me to amke the code better.

Lookng forwrad to the laerning experience and to collaborating with the world!

Warm Regds
Sid
